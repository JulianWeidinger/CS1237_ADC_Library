 ~\newline
 The class is intended to configure and read the values of the ADC, ~\newline
 especially to read it in the background with hardware and timer interrupts, ~\newline
 while the main loop is running and other actions are in progress. ~\newline
 The number of instances is limited to two, because the timing ~\newline
 of the data transmission is critical, when the high sample rate is set, ~\newline
 if you have more than two instances }{\pageref{classCS1237}}{}
