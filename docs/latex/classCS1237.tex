\mbox{\hyperlink{classCS1237}{CS1237}} class ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The class is intended to configure and read the values of the ADC, ~\newline
 especially to read it in the background with hardware and timer interrupts, ~\newline
 while the main loop is running and other actions are in progress. ~\newline
 The number of instances is limited to two, because the timing ~\newline
 of the data transmission is critical, when the high sample rate is set, ~\newline
 if you have more than two instances.

This is the function to return the last value of the measured analog signal. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The function waits until the reading is finished, if a reading is in progress. ~\newline
 The function converts the measured data to a signed 32-\/bit integer and subtracts the offset, ~\newline
 if the tare function has been called before. This value (reading\+\_\+) is returned. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em reading\+\_\+} & the local variable to store the measured analog signal value in\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the last value of the measured analog signal (reading\+\_\+)

This function sets the ADC to sleep mode or wakes the ADC up. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 Furthermore the sleep function makes sure, that after the return ~\newline
 the interrupt of the ADC has happend, to make sure a read operation ~\newline
 won\textquotesingle{}t collide with this interrupt, but only if the sleep\+\_\+-\/flag is set to false.

This function is used, to set the offset value of the analog signal. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The measured analog signal is read for a specific time and added, ~\newline
 to build the average of the measured values. ~\newline
 The average is stored in the public variabele \+\_\+offset. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em time\+\_\+} & This variable sets, how long this function is in progress. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 It correlates with the quantity of the measured values for the average calculation. \\
